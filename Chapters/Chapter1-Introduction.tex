\section{Background}
Welcome to this \LaTeX{} Thesis Template, a beautiful and easy to use template for writing a thesis using the \LaTeX{} typesetting system.

If you are writing a thesis (or will be in the future) and its subject is technical or mathematical (though it doesn't have to be), then creating it in \LaTeX{} is highly recommended as a way to make sure you can just get down to the essential writing without having to worry over formatting or wasting time arguing with your word processor.

\LaTeX{} is easily able to professionally typeset documents that run to hundreds or thousands of pages long. With simple mark-up commands, it automatically sets out the table of contents, margins, page headers and footers and keeps the formatting consistent and beautiful. One of its main strengths is the way it can easily typeset mathematics, even \emph{heavy} mathematics. Even if those equations are the most horribly twisted and most difficult mathematical problems that can only be solved on a super-computer, you can at least count on \LaTeX{} to make them look stunning.

\section{Problem Statement and Research Questions}

\LaTeX{} is not a \textsc{wysiwyg} (What You See is What You Get) program, unlike word processors such as Microsoft Word or Apple's Pages. Instead, a document written for \LaTeX{} is actually a simple, plain text file that contains \emph{no formatting}. You tell \LaTeX{} how you want the formatting in the finished document by writing in simple commands amongst the text, for example, if I want to use \emph{italic text for emphasis}, I write the \verb|\emph{text}| command and put the text I want in italics in between the curly braces. This means that \LaTeX{} is a \enquote{mark-up} language, very much like HTML.

\subsection{A (not so short) Introduction to \LaTeX{}}

If you are new to \LaTeX{}, there is a very good eBook -- freely available online as a PDF file -- called, \enquote{The Not So Short Introduction to \LaTeX{}}. The book's title is typically shortened to just \emph{lshort}. You can download the latest version (as it is occasionally updated) from here:
\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}

It is also available in several other languages. Find yours from the list on this page: \url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/}

It is recommended to take a little time out to learn how to use \LaTeX{} by creating several, small `test' documents, or having a close look at several templates on:\\

Making the effort now means you're not stuck learning the system when what you \emph{really} need to be doing is writing your thesis.

\section{Structure of the Thesis}

If you are familiar with \LaTeX{}, then you should explore the directory structure of the template and then proceed to place your own information into the \emph{THESIS INFORMATION} block of the \file{main.tex} file. You can then modify the rest of this file to your unique specifications based on your degree/university. Section \ref{FillingFile} on page \pageref{FillingFile} will help you do this. Make sure you also read section \ref{ThesisConventions} about thesis conventions to get the most out of this template.

If you are new to \LaTeX{} it is recommended that you carry on reading through the rest of the information in this document.

Before you begin using this template you should ensure that its style complies with the thesis style guidelines imposed by your institution. In most cases this template style and layout will be suitable. If it is not, it may only require a small change to bring the template in line with your institution's recommendations. These modifications will need to be done on the \file{MastersDoctoralThesis.cls} file.
